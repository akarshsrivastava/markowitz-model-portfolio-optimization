# Markowitz model for portfolio optimization

## Model portfolio theory

Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk. Harry Markowitz pioneered this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was published in the Journal of Finance in 1952.

Higher risk is associated with greater probability of higher return and lower risk with a greater probability of smaller return. MPT assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning that given two portfolios that offer the same expected return, investors will prefer the less risky one. Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns.

Modern portfolio theory says that it is not enough to look at the expected risk and return of one particular stock. By investing in more than one stock, an investor can reap the benefits of diversification — chief among them, a reduction in the riskiness of the portfolio. What you need to understand is that “risk of a portfolio is not equal to average/weighted-average of individual stocks in the portfolio”. In terms of return, yes it is the average/weighted average of individual stock’s returns, but that’s not the case for risk. The risk is about how volatile the asset is, if you have more than one stock in your portfolio, then you have to take count of how these stocks movement correlates with each other. The beauty of diversification is that you can even get lower risk than a stock with the lowest risk in your portfolio, by optimising the allocation.
